#  ChainLetter App

A word game app, developed in a week using REPLIT and SwiftUI.
The Logic of the game was first ideated and then made to work on the command line in REPLIT, then it was brought to an xCode project to work with a UI. 

Rules of the Game:
Type in a word that begins with the last letter your opponent used, then your opponent will do the same
You can't repeat words that you or the computer used
Every valid word you enter earns you one point
Game ends when you input an invalid word

## Run Locally

You need xCode installed on a Macintosh computer to run this program.

When installed, open the LetterChain project folder, from their you can see a preivew on the ContentView Canvas, or press Run (cmd + r) to build the app and run it on a virtual device
